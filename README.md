## Introduction 
Malaria is a serious and sometimes fatal disease caused by a parasite that commonly infects a certain type of mosquito which feeds on humans. About 212 million people are infected with malaria each year. Although malaria can be a deadly disease, illness and death from malaria can usually be prevented. The prevention approaches include: being aware of the risk, preventing bites, taking antimalarial tablets, and seek immediate diagnosis when the symptom occurs.  
 
In certain areas along the Greater Mekong Subregion, countries such as Cambodia and Thailand are facing a rapid spread of malaria parasites that are resistant to antimalarial drugs. Thus, making malaria prevention and elimination are an urgent need. 

## Methods
A Serious Game is developed, where the goal of the game is to help and encourage people (potential malaria-infected patients) to have malaria literacy and become aware of its danger. The monsters portray the danger and scariness mosquito to encourage mosquito avoidance. The diamonds portray methods to eliminate and prevent mosquito. The hero portray symptoms and guidance of  action when infected with malaria. The maps portray environmental conditions that are prone to malaria and how to improve the conditions.

### Game-play and Game Mechanic  
Using a Puzzle game where the core gameplay is based on connecting adjacent diamonds among several on the gameboard as to make a row or column of at least three matching-coloured diamonds. The matched diamonds are removed from the board, and new diamonds above them fall into the empty spaces, with new diamonds appearing from the top of the board. This situation may create a new matched set of diamonds, which is automatically cleared in the same manner. The player collects and gains powers progressively while attacking the monster every time diamonds are matches. When a power bar is full, the player will automatically attack the monster with an ultimate attack.  Â 

### Storyline
