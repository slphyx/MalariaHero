Malaria is a serious and sometimes fatal disease caused by a parasite that commonly infects a certain type of mosquito which feeds on humans. About 212 million people are infected with malaria each year. Although malaria can be a deadly disease, illness and death from malaria can usually be prevented. The prevention approaches include: being aware of the risk, preventing bites, taking antimalarial tablets, and seek immediate diagnosis when the symptom occurs.
